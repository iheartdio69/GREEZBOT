          "description": "This is a scalar market on what the USD price of Bitcoin will be on November 4th, 2020, according to Coingecko. The lower bound for this market is $5,000/BTC, and the upper bound is $15,000/BTC - you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short share price corresponds with the BTC price. The market will be settled according to Coingecko’s BTC page at roughly 12pm EST on November 4th, 2020. Long and Short shares will settle proportional to the final value, in the case of the final value being between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Share is capped at $1. Refer to calculator for share price and BTC price correlation. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n",

      "description": "This is a market on if Donald Trump will tweet an announcement that he successfully won the election before November 5th, 12:01 am EST. If Trump says he “Won”, or claims definitive victory, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If he claims he won before the market resolution time, but later admits to losing or informally or formally concedes before November 5th, that will overrule his previous claim of winning, and the market will resolve to “No”.  If he claims something to the effect of that it looks like he is going to win, or he should win, or *should’ve* won, the market will resolve to “No”. The Tweet must be in the form of an announcement claiming victory, not a tweet about rejecting official results and that he should be the winer. If he rejects the results as being insufficient in some way or needing a recount, but does not definitively claim he Won, in the fashion of claiming victory, the market will resolve to “No”. If the election hasn’t been called yet by resolution time, and Trump has not definitively claimed victory, the market will resolve to “No”. If Trump wins and announces it via Tweet before resolution time, the market will resolve to “Yes”. It boils down to Trump tweeting definitively that he successfully won, not that the results are wrong and he should’ve won: it must resemble a victory tweet. This tweet must come from one of his official Twitter accounts, either https://twitter.com/POTUS or\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump and does not include Retweets. We're aware this is not the most unambiguous metric to resolve the market on, however the Market Integrity Committee will resolve this market in good faith as objectively accurate as possible.",

      "description": "This is a market on if the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain genesis event will happen successfully on December 1st, 2020, as planned contingent on the ETH deposit threshold being met in time. The ETH 2 “MIN_GENESIS_TIME” is December 1, 2020, 12pm UTC. If the genesis event doesn’t happen by December 1st, 11:59pm EST, this market will resolve to “No” - and in the unlikely scenario that it happens before November 30th, 11:59pm UTC, the market will also resolve to “No”. The threshold for the genesis event to occur on December 1st is for there to be at least 16,384 32-ETH validator deposits, 7 days prior to December 1st.

          "description": "This is a market on if the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain genesis event will happen successfully on December 1st, 2020, as planned contingent on the ETH deposit threshold being met in time. The ETH 2 “MIN_GENESIS_TIME” is December 1, 2020, 12pm UTC. If the genesis event doesn’t happen by December 1st, 11:59pm EST, this market will resolve to “No” - and in the unlikely scenario that it happens before November 30th, 11:59pm UTC, the market will also resolve to “No”. The threshold for the genesis event to occur on December 1st is for there to be at least 16,384 32-ETH validator deposits, 7 days prior to December 1st. If the threshold is met, and the genesis event doesn’t happen successfully before resolution time due to unforeseen circumstances, the market will still resolve to “No”.

As per Wikipedia: \"In politics, a concession is the act of a losing candidate publicly yielding to a winning candidate after an election after the overall result of the vote has become clear.\" If Trump tweets or publicly states that he lost or concedes the US Presidential Election, and will not be President come next term, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". If he says something to the effect of Joe Biden winning \"but...\", but in the context of him still contesting results, saying he should have won and he is taking action to try and still win, this market will resolve to \"No\". We are aware this market may be ambiguous, however it will be resolved in good faith as accurately as possible, by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).

          "description": "This is a market on if Donald Trump will formally concede the 2020 US Election before December 1st, 2020, 12:00am EST. Conceding can be defined as publicly admitting to losing the election and thus not being president come next term. As per Wikipedia: \"In politics, a concession is the act of a losing candidate publicly yielding to a winning candidate after an election after the overall result of the vote has become clear.\" If Trump tweets or publicly states that he lost or concedes the US Presidential Election, and will not be President come next term, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". If he says something to the effect of Joe Biden winning \"but...\", but in the context of him still contesting results, saying he should have won and he is taking action to try and still win, this market will resolve to \"No\". We are aware this market may be ambiguous, however it will be resolved in good faith as accurately as possible, by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC). Also this Facebook Forecast question, https://www.forecastapp.net/q/TWFya2V0Ollwd0JkSUlOdzRB/, will be referenced as a leading resolution source, along with the Associated Press.",

This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump attends the swearing-in ceremony of Joe Biden's presidential inauguration in person, according to both sources deemed appropriate by the Forecast team, or empirically by watching the inauguration on a livestream. In any case of Donald Trump not attending Joe Biden's official inauguration, the market will resolve to \"No\". In the case that the inauguration takes place in some form of hybrid online/in-person ceremony, if Trump is not physically present at the in-person segment of this, in the same place as Joe Biden, the market resolves to “No.” \n\nIf, for any reason, Biden is not inaugurated, the market will resolve to \"No\". This includes if Trump is inaugurated instead: the market will still resolve to \"No\". The swearing-in ceremony is a publicly televised event and it will be abundantly clear whether or not Donald Trump is present based on the media coverage of inauguration day. Televised video coverage from various outlets will be used to verify his attendance. If no inauguration takes place before February 1st, 2021, this market will resolve to \"No\". In the case of any ambiguity in regards to the market resolution, it will be resolved in good faith by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

          "description": "This is a market on if Sushiswap will have more Total Value Locked (TVL) than Uniswap, at any time before November 24th, 2020, 12:00am EST. This market’s inception date is November 18th, 2020, and thus the market conditions can only be satisfied after this date. The market will resolve to “Yes” if, at any time, Sushiswap has a higher overall TVL than Uniswap, and “No” if the end date is reached without this condition being met. \n\nThe resolution condition is being tracked with the DefiPulse API as defined as the following API endpoints (with a valid API key): \n- [https://data-api.defipulse.com/api/v1/defipulse/api/GetHistory?project=uniswap](https://data-api.defipulse.com/api/v1/defipulse/api/GetHistory?project=uniswap)\n- [https://data-api.defipulse.com/api/v1/defipulse/api/GetHistory?project=sushiswap](https://data-api.defipulse.com/api/v1/defipulse/api/GetHistory?project=sushiswap)\n\nThe market will resolve to “Yes” if, for any timestamp after November 18th 2020, these feeds report Sushiswap has a higher overall TVL in USD than Uniswap, and “No” if the end date is reached without this condition being met. If, for any reason, the API feed malfunctions or is unable to report on TVL, this market will be resolved in good faith empirically on the terms that Sushiswap has a higher TVL than Uniswap at any time before the resolution date. In the case of ambiguity in terms of the outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

All prices denominated in US Dollar.\n\nAs this is a Scalar market, you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the Jordan 1 Mocha's average price on that day. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.

The linked PredictIt question is the basis for the creation of this market and will be referenced as the leading resolution source, https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/6453/Will-Trump-pardon-himself-in-his-first-term. This market will resolve when the PredictIt market is resolved, to the same outcome.\n\nPredictit Description:\nDuring his first term, President Donald Trump shall grant a pardon to himself for one or more criminal offences, charges or convictions. Such pardon will be considered to have been granted only if Mr. Trump himself appears on the official list of presidential pardons granted by President Trump, maintained by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney (available upon launch of this market at https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemencyrecipients) by 11:59 pm on February 15, 2021 (the “End Date”).\n\nA self-pardon for Mr. Trump that is announced but does not appear on such official list by the End Date shall not be sufficient to cause this market to resolve Yes.

The average sale price will be calculated using the average of the sales from 12:00 PM EST on December 25th, 2020 till 8 PM EST on December 25th, 2020. The average sale price will be computed by taking the simple average (Sum of sale prices divided by number of sales that took place within the time period) based on the sales occurring during the previously defined time window at the webpage listed above. All prices denominated in US Dollar.\n\nAs this is a Scalar market, you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the PS5's average price on that day. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

All prices denominated in US Dollar.\n\nAs this is a Scalar market, you can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the PS5's average price on that day. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

          "description": "This is a market on if Donald Trump will pardon an immediate family member prior to the end of his current presidential term (January 21st, 2021). In the event that Donald Trump does pardon an immediate family member, this will be recorded by the Department of Justice here: https://www.justice.gov/pardon/pardons-granted-president-donald-trump. This market will resolve to “Yes“ if, during his first term as President, Donald Trump pardons any of the following: Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump, and Jared Kushner. If none of the listed family members are pardoned by the resolution date, this market will resolve to “No“. Any Trump family member not included in the above list will not be considered for this market. If any such pardon is issued after the specified date, January 21st, 2021, this market will resolve to “No.” This market specifically requires the Presidential pardon to be issued during Donald Trump’s current term in office. In the event of any ambiguity, this market will be resolved in good faith and as intended by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\nClarification: If the pardon is not listed by the resolution source on the resolution date, the market will resolve to \"No\". \"Secret pardons\" which are not listed on the website by the resolution date will not satisfy the requirement to resolve to \"Yes\", nor will the resolution date be extended.\n",

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @DonaldJTrumpJr, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@DonaldJTrumpJr\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @DonaldJTrumpJr just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Donald Trump Jr., nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to \"49 or less\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to \"49 or less\". The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @DonaldJTrumpJr will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com.

      "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Elon Musk's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 3, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @ElonMusk, shall exceed 13,407 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @ElonMusk, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@ElonMusk\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @ElonMusk just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Elon Musk, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @ElonMusk will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

      "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Mark Cuban's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 10, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @MCuban, shall exceed 3,453 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @MCuban, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@MCuban\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @MCuban just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Mark Cuban, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @MarkCuban will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

      "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Mark Cuban's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 17, 2021 at 3:00pm EST.\n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @MCuban, shall exceed 3,478 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @MCuban, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@MCuban\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @MCuban just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Mark Cuban, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @MarkCuban will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

          "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets which will be posted to Mark Cuban's Twitter account prior to the resolution date, February 17, 2021 at 3:00pm EST.\n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @MCuban, shall exceed 3,478 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @MCuban, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@MCuban\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @MCuban just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Mark Cuban, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @MarkCuban will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @SouljaBoy, then clicking the verified account labeled “@SouljaBoy” from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @SouljaBoy just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Soulja Boy, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @SouljaBoy will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @WHCOS just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Ronald Klain, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @WHCOS will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

      "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets that will be posted to White House Chief of Staff’s Twitter account prior to the resolution date, March 12, 2021 at 3:00pm EST. \n\nAt 3:00pm EST on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @WHCOS, shall exceed 1506 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @WHCOS, then clicking the verified account labeled “@WHCOS” from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @WHCOS just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Ronald Klain, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @WHCOS will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform. Once one of these projects has a live token, this market will resolve to \"Yes\".

In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions. For clarity, this market is about fungible tokens, and not NFTs related to a platform. Once one of these projects has a live token, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". If the resolution date is reached and none of the projects have a token, the market will resolve to \"No\". In the case of ambiguity, the market will be resolved in good faith by the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @mtgreenee, then clicking the verified account labeled “@mtgreenee” from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @mtgreenee just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Marjorie Taylor Greene, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @mtgreenee will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data. Note that the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.4%, 0.1%, etc).

          "description": "This is a scalar market on what the winning bid for Beeple's “Ocean Front” will be in USD. The lower bound for this market is $5 million, and the upper bound is $50 million. You can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with sale price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.\n\n The auction is being conducted by Nifty Gateway and is scheduled to end on March 22. In the event the auction is postponed, resolution of this market will be delayed accordingly. If the auction is canceled entirely, this market will resolve to the lower bound, $5 million. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

      "description": "This is a market on the number of tweets that will be posted to Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Twitter account prior to the resolution date, March 30, 2021 at 3:00 PM ET. \n\nAt 3:00 PM ET on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @mtgreenee, shall exceed 11,464  (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @mtgreenee, then clicking the verified account labeled “@mtgreenee” from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @mtgreenee just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Marjorie Taylor Greene, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @mtgreenee will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n",

If Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the most recent available disapproval rating. The resolution date for this market will be on April 8, 2021 at 12:00 PM ET according to data published for the day of April 7, 2021.

This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @laurenboebert, then clicking the verified account labeled “@laurenboebert” from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @laurenboebert just before 3:00pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets on the resolution date exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to the resolution date of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Lauren Boebert, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the resolution source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, suspension, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, this market will resolve to the lowest bracket. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @laurenboebert will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

A successful launch will mean that Starship SN15 successfully takes off from its launchpad in Boca Chica, TX, and sustains flight for longer than 10 seconds. A successful landing will mean that the Starship SN15 lands in the designated landing area and remains upright for at least 1 hour after landing. The successful launch and landing will be corroborated by examining SpaceX’s official video feed of the launch (https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX), as well as secondary video feeds if necessary. If the Starship SN15 completes a successful launch and landing by April 28, 2021, 12:00 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.

      "description": "At 3:00 PM ET on the resolution date, the number of total tweets posted by the Twitter account @ElonMusk, shall exceed 13,963 (the \"Baseline\") by the number or range identified in the contract, as indicated by the number under the label \"TWEETS\" on the account detail viewable on the desktop version of https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/. This account detail can be viewed by using a Twitter account to log into the website https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/, searching for @ElonMusk, then clicking the verified account labeled \"@ElonMusk\" from the search results. Should the total tweets reported by that source at that time appear not to include one or more tweets posted by @ElonMusk just before 3:00 pm, and still available on that account's timeline at 3:00 pm, Polymarket may use additional sources in determining whether any such tweet(s) should be included in the market's resolution. The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n\nNeither Elon Musk, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account. Should the settlement source be unavailable at that date and time, for any reason other than deletion, deactivation, or a change in the privacy settings of the account, Polymarket may postpone settlement of this market until the source becomes available. In such a case, the account's total tweets will be measured once Polymarket becomes aware that the source has again become available. If Polymarket deems the source to be permanently unavailable, the lowest bracket will resolve to \"Yes\". Should an updated count of total tweets not be available from twitter.com at the date and time of expiration, due to apparent deletion, deactivation, or a change in privacy settings by a user of the account or by Twitter, all contracts in this market will resolve as No. The blocking of one or more Twitter accounts by @ElonMusk will not be considered to render the settlement source unavailable.\n\nShould the navigation, layout, URL, or labeling of the elements of the settlement source be altered by Twitter or Tweetdeck prior to expiration (other than via deletion or deactivation of the account), this market will still be resolved according to the aforementioned formula, so long as Polymarket can reasonably determine the relevant number of total tweets from twitter.com. The merging, migration, or other combination of one or more Twitter accounts will not in and of itself cause the settlement source to be considered unavailable, so long as an updated count of total tweets can be determined according to the aforementioned formula, even if such combination causes an increase or decrease in that count that does not represent the number of tweets posted to the account during the time period in question.\n\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

This market will resolve to “Yes” if, for any date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. This market will resolve to “No” if there is not a single date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), where the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. Specifically, at 8:00 PM ET each day from April 23 to April 30, 2021, the daily case total for all previous days will be checked. If that count is over 475,000 at the time of any one of those checks, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If at the time of the final check, on April 30, 2021, 8:00 PM ET, the count for all previous dates never exceeds 475,000, this market will resolve to “No”.

The resolution source for this market will be the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India, as reported by the World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/in). This market will resolve to “Yes” if, for any date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. This market will resolve to “No” if there is not a single date from April 23 to April 29 (inclusive), where the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in India for that date was higher than 475,000. Specifically, at 8:00 PM ET each day from April 23 to April 30, 2021, the daily case total for all previous days will be checked. If that count is over 475,000 at the time of any one of those checks, this market will resolve to “Yes”. If at the time of the final check, on April 30, 2021, 8:00 PM ET, the count for all previous dates never exceeds 475,000, this market will resolve to “No”. If the WHO website is down at the time of resolution, market resolution will be delayed until the website is restored, or if it is not restored within 48 hours, this market will resolve such that “Yes” and “No” shares are both worth 0.50 USDC.\n",

This market will resolve to “Yes” if President Biden cumulatively mentions any of the following words three or more times: “coronavirus”, “covid”, “COVID-19”. For example, this market would resolve to “Yes” if Biden mentions “coronavirus” 5 times and none of the other variants (5 cumulative mentions) or if he mentions “coronavirus” twice and “covid” twice (4 cumulative mentions). This market will resolve to \"No\" otherwise. The resolution source for this market will be the official transcript of the joint address, as published by an official White House source (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/). Note that a mention of any of the listed words will be confirmed by searching the text of this document and counting the number of times that word appeared (all variations on capitalization will be counted). This market will resolve after an official transcript of the address is published and the number of mentions can be verified.\n\nUpdate: In response to trader inquiries, the market will resolve on April 29, 2021 at 9pm ET according to the transcript published at the resolution source that most accurately reflects the speech as presented by President Biden.",

This market will resolve to “Yes” if President Biden cumulatively mentions any of the following words three or more times: “coronavirus”, “covid”, “COVID-19”. For example, this market would resolve to “Yes” if Biden mentions “coronavirus” 5 times and none of the other variants (5 cumulative mentions) or if he mentions “coronavirus” twice and “covid” twice (4 cumulative mentions). This market will resolve to \"No\" otherwise. The resolution source for this market will be the official transcript of the joint address, as published by an official White House source (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/). Note that a mention of any of the listed words will be confirmed by searching the text of this document and counting the number of times that word appeared (all variations on capitalization will be counted). This market will resolve after an official transcript of the address is published and the number of mentions can be verified.\n\nUpdate: In response to trader inquiries, the market will resolve on April 29, 2021 at 9pm ET according to the transcript published at the resolution source that most accurately reflects the speech as presented by President Biden.",

Otherwise, if the criteria for this market to resolve to “Yes” are not met by the resolution date, this market will resolve to “No”.

The market will resolve to “Yes” if the Oversight Board announces a decision which has the effect of allowing Facebook to continue to indefinitely or permanently ban Donald Trump from posting to his Facebook account. This market will resolve to “No” in any other case. For instance, if the Oversight Board issues a decision which has the effect of requiring Facebook to reinstate Donald Trump’s account by some date or under some conditions (e.g. he can’t post about certain topics), this market will resolve to “No”. The resolution source for this market will be the contents of the decision published by the Oversight Board to their website (https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/). If no decision is announced by the Oversight Committee by June 1, 2021, 12:00 PM ET, this market will resolve 50-50. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n",

This market will resolve to “Yes” if A Quiet Place Part II grosses more than $50,203,562 on opening weekend, defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release, and “No” Otherwise. The resolution source will be https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2819065345/, under the “Domestic Weekend” tab. To resolve the market, the source will be checked on June 1, 2021, 5 PM ET. If the box office sales data is based on a studio estimate rather than actual data, or if there is no data available, the source will be checked 24 hours later, and so on until the actual data is available. If the actual data is not available on the resolution source by June 10, 2021, 5 PM ET, then the market will resolve to 50-50. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\n\n",

The resolution source for this market will be the CDC’s count for the number of new daily COVID-19 cases, as displayed on their COVID Data Tracker (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailytrendscases). This market will resolve to “Yes” if the daily count for total new cases falls below 1,000 for any date from May 19, 2021 to September 1, 2021. Specifically, at 8:00 PM ET each day from May 20 to September 2, 2021, the daily case total for all previous days will be checked (e.g. on June 15, case counts for all dates from May 19 to June 14 will be checked). If that count is under 1,000 at the time of any one of those checks, this market will resolve to “Yes”. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nUnusual Cases:\n- If the CDC website is down at the time of the final check, market resolution will be delayed until the website is restored, or if it is not restored within 48 hours, this market will resolve to 50-50.\n- If, at the time of a check, data is unavailable for any of the dates being checked, only dates for which there is data will be considered (e.g. if on the June 15 check, there is no data for the date of June 10, only data from May 19 to June 9 and June 11 to June 14 will be considered). If data is not available for any of the dates from May 19, 2021, to September 1, 2021, within 48 hours of the final check (by September 4, 2021, 8:00 PM ET), this market will resolve on data from dates for which data is available.\n\nUpdate: The market title has been updated to \"Will the US have fewer than 1000 COVID-19 cases on any day on or before September 1?\" to more clearly reflect the rules.",

The election is scheduled to take place on June 6, 2021. The lower bound for this market is -2 (Fujimori) and the upper bound is +4 (Castillo). Margin of victory will be calculated by the following formula: Castillo (percentage of vote) - Fujimori (percentage of vote). For instance, if Castillo received 49.3% of the vote, and Fujimori received 50.7% of the vote, the margin of victory would be (49.3% - 50.7%= -1.4%). Note that full unrounded percentages calculated from raw vote numbers will be used, and the total votes will be considered as Fujimori votes + Castillo votes. For instance, Fujimori’s percentage would be calculated as 100 * (# Fujimori Votes / (# Fujimori Votes + # Castillo Votes)).\n\nThe resolution source will be https://www.onpe.gob.pe/. To allow for potential updates to results, the earliest resolution of this market will be 1.5 weeks after the election date, i.e. on June 17, 12 PM ET, upon which the resolution source will be checked. If the results are available at that time, the market will resolve according to the results posted on the website at that time. Note that these results need not be the final results — the market will resolve based on the numbers available at June 17, 12 PM ET exactly. If results are unavailable at the resolution source, the source will be checked a day later on June 18, 12 PM ET, and so on until results are available. If results are not available on the resolution source by June 30, 12 PM ET, the market will resolve to +0 margin of victory. Only the results on the webpage when checked at the resolution time will be considered. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, this market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with the margin of victory. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0.

The resolution source for this market will be daily checkpoint throughput as measured by the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput. This market will resolve to “Yes” if the TSA reports a daily checkpoint throughput of more than 2 million for any day on or after June 3, 2021 and on or before June 15, 2021. This market will resolve to “No” otherwise. This market will resolve as soon as throughput data becomes available for the date of June 15, 2021 or on any date before that on or after June 3, 2021 if the target is reached. If data is not available for any of the days from June 3 to June 15 by June 30, 2021, the market will resolve to 50-50.  Any revisions published to data for dates on or after June 3 prior to the release of data for June 15, 2021 will be considered.

      "description": "This is a market on whether Logan Paul will knock down Floyd Mayweather, in their exhibition boxing match, scheduled to take place on June 6, 2021 at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. This market will resolve to “Yes” if Logan Paul knocks down Floyd Mayweather in their exhibition boxing match. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”. For this market, “knocks down Floyd Mayweather” will mean that Paul delivers a legal blow such that (1) any part of Mayweather’s body that is not his feet touches the canvas, or (2) Mayweather is being held up by the ropes or hanging on to the ropes (i.e. Mayweather would have fallen had the ropes not been there), in either case resulting in the referee delivering a mandatory count or stopping the fight due to a knockout. Accidental slips or falls will not count. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, this market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n",

The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana). This market will resolve on the “C” (i.e. closing price) listed for the candle titled “Thu 24 June 2021, 12:00:00”, with the “Price” tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on June 24, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the “C:” when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith by the MIC to resolve the market.\n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $SOL's price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

          "description": "This is a scalar market on what the price of $SOL (Solana) will be on June 24, 12:00 PM ET. The lower bound for this market is $25.00, and the upper bound is $60.00. The resolution source for this market will be prices listed on CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana). This market will resolve on the “C” (i.e. closing price) listed for the candle titled “Thu 24 June 2021, 12:00:00”, with the “Price” tab selected, in the Eastern Time Zone. Note, this 12:00:00 candle lists the opening price for 11:30:00 AM ET and the closing price for 12:00:00 PM ET. To allow for updates, this market will resolve on the number listed for the referenced candle at exactly 12:25:00 PM ET, on June 24, 2021. (To see the candlestick close price, click the candlestick icon, and observe the number after the “C:” when you hover over a candlestick for a given time period.) If Coingecko is unavailable at the resolution time, another credible source will be chosen in good faith by the MIC to resolve the market.\n\nYou can use the calculator to the right (underneath the Buy modal) to calculate how each Long or Short Token price corresponds with $SOL's price. Long and Short shares will settle proportionally to the outcome value if the final value is between these bounds, but if the final value exceeds either the upper or lower bound, the price of each Outcome Token is capped at $1 and $0. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",

          "description": "This is a market on whether a total of 14,554 tweets or more will be posted by the @elonmusk Twitter account, as indicated by the resolution source (https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/), by the resolution date of 3:00 PM ET, June 17, 2021. This would be 71 more than the number of tweets posted from @elonmusk, according to the resolution source, at the time of the creation of this market (which stands at 14,483, the “Baseline”). This market will resolve to “Yes” if the resolution source indicates 14,554 or more tweets have been posted from the @elonmusk Twitter account, by the resolution date. This market will resolve to “No” if the resolution source indicates 14,553 or fewer tweets have been posted from the @elonmusk Twitter account, by the resolution date. Should the resolution source be unavailable at the time of resolution, this market will resolve 50-50. In the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved in good faith at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).\n\nAdditional Market Information:\n- To see the official cumulative tweet count on the resolution source, search the resolution source for the verified @elonmusk twitter account, and check the cumulative numbers of tweets under the “TWEETS” field.\n- The number by which the total tweets at expiration exceeds the Baseline may not equal the number of tweets actually posted over that time period, in light of numerous factors, including but not limited to the fact that the account's total tweets upon launch of the market may differ from the Baseline, tweets may be deleted prior to expiration of this market, and specialized tweets such as quotes, retweets, replies, promoted tweets, may or may not be included in that total.\n- Neither Elon Musk, nor any authorized user of the account in question, need be the author of any such tweets, nor must any authorized user maintain control of the account.",
